### Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This web app lets you see how different sorting algorithms work through interactive visualizations. It supports a variety of sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samanthacabrera/array-sorting-visualizer.git
cd array-sorting-visualizer
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.

### Understanding the Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are ways to arrange data in a specific order—usually ascending or descending. Each algorithm works differently and has its own strengths and weaknesses. This project includes five popular algorithms:

</br>

**Bubble Sort** compares pairs of nums and swaps if needed, until largest 'bubbles' to end.

</br>

**Merge Sort** divides the list into smaller sublists until each contains one element, then 'merges' the sublists in sorted order.

</br>

**Quick Sort** selects a pivot, separates smaller and bigger numbers around it, then sorts each part.

</br>

**Insertion Sort** goes through the list one number at a time, inserting each one into its correct spot among the already sorted numbers.

**Selection Sort** repeatedly finds the smallest unsorted element and swaps it into its correct position in the sorted part of the list.

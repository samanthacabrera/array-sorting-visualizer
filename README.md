### Understanding the Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are ways to arrange data in a specific order. While they all aim to sort information, each algorithm has its own strategy, along with unique advantages and trade-offs. This project includes breakdowns of five popular algorithms:

</br>

**Bubble Sort** compares pairs of nums and swaps if needed, until largest 'bubbles' to end.

</br>

**Merge Sort** divides the list into smaller sublists until each contains one element, then 'merges' the sublists in sorted order.

</br>

**Quick Sort** selects a pivot, separates smaller and bigger numbers around it, then sorts each part.

</br>

**Insertion Sort** goes through the list one number at a time, inserting each one into its correct spot among the already sorted numbers.

</br>

**Selection Sort** repeatedly finds the smallest unsorted element and swaps it into its correct position in the sorted part of the list.
